Simple fun app to play a sound when you touch a button, or when you whip your phone.

This app is 1st attempt to create an Android app, but it is quite fun to use. You can virtually
whip your find, or make fun of them. You can play the Dun Dun Duuun or Suspens sound when
someone is down during a murder party :-) . Did you see some The Big Bang Theory episode when
they whip each other or play a murder party ? The sounds are almose the same, and you can
use the app like they do it on the show.

Help :
Push a button, and the sound is played. Quite simple :-) !
The bottom button with the icon repeat the last played sound.
You can also use the keyboard (Key 1 to 5, and R for repeating the last sound).
The last sound is also played when you do a whip move with your phone.

The sounds can't be changed (it will come in a future version).

Sounds are made by myself, or came from Simon Lacelle (see freesound.org) or from Dick De Benedictis.
All of them are open and free to use.
