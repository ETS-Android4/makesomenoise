## My first Android application.

### First attempt to create a Android application, using Android Studio 3.

The goal of this app is to play some fun sounds when a button is pressed, or when the phone is moved.

Sounds played :
- Whip : to make you work harder (like in The Big Bang Theory)
- Drama : the drama sound (also like in The Big Bang Theory) to increase dramatic suspense of the situation
- Laugh : a crowd laugh when someone did a good joke
- Bad Joke : the drums sounds for a not-so-good joke
- Tada : the (in)famous windows tada sound

The wav sound files are stored in app/src/main/res/raw .

TODO
- Play the Whip sound when the phone is whiped (dedicated to The Big Bang Theory)
- Allow sound configuration depending on the phone move
