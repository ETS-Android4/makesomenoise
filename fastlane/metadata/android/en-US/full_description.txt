Simple fun app to play a sound when you touch a button, or when you
whip your phone.
This app is 1st attempt to create an Android app, but it is quite fun
to use. You can virtually whip your find, or make fun of them. You can
play the Dun Dun Duuun or Suspens sound when someone is down during a
murder party :-) . Did you see some The Big Bang Theory episode when
they whip each other or play a murder party ? The sounds are almost the
same, and you can use the app like they do it on the show.

You can also use the keyboard (Key 1 to 5, and R for repeating the last sound).

The sounds can't be changed (it will come in a future version).
